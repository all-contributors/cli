## Configuration

You can configure the project by creating a `.all-contributorsrc` JSON file.

```json
{
  "file": "README.md",
  "owner": "jfmengels",
  "emoji": {
    "cheerful": ":smiley:"
  }
}
```
or creating a `all-contributors` updating the `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "all-contributors-cli",
  "...": "...",
  "all-contributors": {
    "file": "README.md",
    "owner": "jfmengels"
  }
}
```

These are the keys you can specify:
- `emoji`: Specify custom emoji, can override the documented emojis. It doesn't really have to be emojis really.
- `file`: File to write the list of contributors in. Default: 'README.md'
- `imageSize`: Size (in px) of the user's avatar. Default: 100.
- `owner`: Name of the user the project is hosted by. Example: `jfmengels/all-contributor-cli` --> `jfmengels`. By default will be parsed from the repo's homepage in `package.json` (TODO).
- `project`: Name of the project. Example: `jfmengels/all-contributor-cli` --> `all-contributor-cli`. Default: Name of the project written in the `package.json` file (TODO).
- `template`: Define your own contributor template. Please read the code to see what you can define (**warning**: not sure it will work well after several tries).
